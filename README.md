# Practice Session Tracker (Backend API)

## Problem Statement
As a music hobbyist, I struggle with ineffective practice sessions. I often:
- Copy pieces from YouTube without learning to read music
- Practice without structure or time constraints
- Don't track progress or identify weak areas
- Lose motivation without clear goals

This leads to slow improvement in core skills like music theory, note reading, and technique.

## Solution
A practice tracking API that helps musicians:
- Log structured practice sessions
- Track time spent and progress over time
- Identify patterns in their practice
- Build consistent practice habits with statistics and streaks

## MVP Features (v1.0)
- **User Authentication**: Register, login, JWT-based auth
- **Practice Sessions**: Create, read, update, delete sessions
- **Session Details**: Date, duration, instrument, pieces/skills practiced, tempo, notes
- **Practice History**: View all sessions, filter by date/instrument
- **Statistics**: Total time, practice streaks, most practiced items

## Future Features (v2.0+)
- Practice goals and reminders
- Piece library with progress tracking
- Skill categorization (scales, sight-reading, repertoire)
- Music file upload with AI-powered recommendations (***)
- Practice quality self-assessment
- Weekly/monthly progress reports

## Tech Stack
- Node.js + Express
- PostgreSQL
- JWT Authentication
-
